## üîß Node Type Management

TopoVis v2.1.0 introduces a sophisticated, database-driven node type management system that provides intelligent type isolation and promotion capabilities.

### Type Categories

- **üîí Default Types**: System-provided types (Router, Switch, PC, etc.) - cannot be deleted
- **‚≠ê Admin Types**: System-wide types created by administrators - visible to all users
- **üë§ User Types**: Custom types created by individual users - isolated per user

### Intelligent Type Isolation

- **User Privacy**: Users can only see default types, admin types, and their own custom types
- **Admin Visibility**: Admins see default types, admin types, and their own types (not other users')
- **No Conflicts**: Users can create types with the same names as other users (isolated)

### Type Promotion System

- **üìà Promotion Interface**: Admin panel dropdown for selecting user types to promote
- **üîÑ Automatic Merging**: When promoting a type, all duplicates with the same name are automatically merged
- **üéØ Smart Consolidation**: Nodes using duplicate types are updated to use the promoted type
- **üíæ Data Integrity**: Transaction-based operations ensure safe promotion and merging

### Admin Panel Features

- **Device Types Manager**: View and manage all system types with category badges
- **Promotion Controls**: Dropdown interface for selecting user types to promote
- **Type Creation**: Create new admin-level types for system-wide use
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded badges (Default, Admin, Custom) for easy identification

## üîí Network Access Control

TopoVis v2.1.0 introduces sophisticated network access control, allowing network owners to precisely manage who can access their networks.

### Access Levels

- **üîí Private**: Only the network owner can access (default for new networks)
- **üë• Shared**: Specific users can be granted access by the owner
- **üåê Public**: All authenticated users can access the network

### User Sharing Features

- **Selective Access**: Choose exactly which users can access your networks
- **Owner Protection**: Network owners are automatically included and cannot be removed
- **Role-Based Filtering**: See only relevant users when setting up sharing
- **Real-time Updates**: Access changes take effect immediately

### Use Cases

- **Team Collaboration**: Share network designs with team members
- **Client Presentations**: Grant temporary access to stakeholders
- **Training**: Allow students to view but not modify networks
- **Audit Trails**: Track who has access to sensitive network designs

---

## üîí Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt
- **Session Management**: Secure express-session configuration
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions for different user types
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries
- **Network Access Control**: Granular network sharing with user-level permissions
- **Owner Protection**: Network owners cannot be accidentally locked out
- **Documentation Protection**: Prompts users before deleting nodes with documentation

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**: Change the port in `app.js` or kill existing processes
2. **Database Errors**: Delete `database/topovis.db` to reset the database
3. **Permission Denied**: Ensure the `database/` directory is writable
4. **Network Access Issues**: Check that users have proper access permissions
5. **Modal Display Problems**: Ensure Alpine.js is properly loaded and initialized
6. **Tree Navigation Issues**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors in wiki page
7. **UUID Conflicts**: Ensure imported networks generate new UUIDs to prevent database conflicts

### Debug Mode
Check browser console for detailed error messages and Alpine.js component state.
